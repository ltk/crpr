module PiplApi

# Ruby wrapper for easily making calls to Pipl's Search API.
# 
# Pipl's Search API allows you to query with the information you have about
# a person (his name, address, email, phone, username and more) and in response 
# get all the data available on him on the web.
# 
# The classes contained in this module are:
# - SearchAPIRequest -- Build your request and send it.
# - SearchAPIResponse -- Holds the response from the API in case it contains data.
# - SearchAPIError -- An exception raised when the API response is an error.
# 
# The classes are based on the person data-model that's implemented here in data.rb

class SearchAPIRequest
    # A request to Pipl's Search API.
    # 
    # Building the request from the query parameters can be done in two ways:
    # 
    # Option 1 - directly and quickly (for simple requests with only few 
    #            parameters):
    #         
    # require 'search'
    # request = PiplApi::SearchAPIRequest.new({ :api_key => 'samplekey', 
    #                                                            :email => 'eric@cartman.com' })
    # response = request.send()
    # 
    # Option 2 - using the data-model (useful for more complex queries; for 
    #            example, when there are multiple parameters of the same type 
    #            such as few phones or a few addresses or when you'd like to use 
    #            information beyond the usual identifiers such as name or email, 
    #            information like education, job, relationships etc):
    #         
    # require 'search'
    # require 'data/fields'
    # fields = [PiplApi::Name.new({ :first => 'Eric', :last => 'Cartman'} ),
    #             PiplApi::Address.new({ :country => 'US', :state => 'CO', :city => 'South Park' }),
    #             PiplApi::Address.new({ :country => 'US', :state => 'NY' }),
    #             PiplApi::Job.new({ :title => 'Actor' })]
    # request = PiplApi::SearchAPIRequest.new({ :api_key => 'samplekey',
    #                                                            :person => PiplApi::Person.new({ :fields => fields }) })
    # response = request.send()
    # 
    # The request also supports prioritizing/filtering the type of records you
    # prefer to get in the response (see the append_priority_rule and 
    # add_records_filter methods).
    # 
    # Sending the request and getting the response is very simple and can be done
    # by either making a blocking call to request.send() or by making 
    # a non-blocking call to request.send_async(callback) which sends the request 
    # asynchronously.

        # and phone of the person).
        # 
        # Args:
        # 
        # api_key -- str, a valid API key (use "samplekey" for experimenting).
        #            Note that you can set a default API key 
        #            (PiplApi::SearchApi.default_api_key = '<your_key>') instead of 
        #            passing it to each request object. 
        # first_name -- unicode, minimum 2 chars.
        # middle_name -- unicode.

        # raw_name -- unicode, an unparsed name containing at least a first name 
        #             and a last name.
        # email -- unicode.
        # phone -- int/long. If a unicode/str is passed instead then it'll be 
        #          striped from all non-digit characters and converted to int.
        #          IMPORTANT: Currently only US/Canada phones can be searched by
        #          so country code is assumed to be 1, phones with different 
        #          country codes are considered invalid and will be ignored.
        # username -- unicode, minimum 4 chars.
        # country -- unicode, a 2 letter country code from:
        #            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2
        # state -- unicode, a state code from:

        #           the same type (for example: two emails, three addresses etc.)
        # query_params_mode -- str, one of "and"/"or" (default "and").
        #                      Advanced parameter, use only if you care about the 
        #                      value of record.query_params_match in the response 
        #                      records.
        #                      Each record in the response has an attribute 
        #                      "query_params_match" which indicates whether the 
        #                      record has the all fields from the query or not.
        #                      When set to "and" all query params are required in 
        #                      order to get query_params_match=True, when set to 
        #                      "or" it's enough that the record has at least one
        #                      of each field type (so if you search with a name 
        #                      and two addresses, a record with the name and one 
        #                      of the addresses will have query_params_match=true)

        #               If set to True the names in the query will be matched 
        #               "as is" without compensating for nicknames or multiple
        #               family names. For example "Jane Brown-Smith" won't return 
        #               results for "Jane Brown" in the same way "Alexandra Pitt"
        #               won't return results for "Alex Pitt".

class SearchAPIResponse
    # A response from Pipl's Search API.
    # 
    # A response comprises the two things returned as a result to your query:
    # 
    # - A person (piplapis.data.containers.Person) that is the deta object 
    #   representing all the information available for the person you were 
    #   looking for.
    #   This object will only be returned when our identity-resolution engine is
    #   convinced that the information is of the person represented by your query.
    #   Obviously, if the query was for "John Smith" there's no way for our
    #   identity-resolution engine to know which of the hundreds of thousands of
    #   people named John Smith you were referring to, therefore you can expect
    #   that the response will not contain a person object.
    #   On the other hand, if you search by a unique identifier such as email or
    #   a combination of identifiers that only lead to one person, such as
    #   "Eric Cartman, Age 22, From South Park, CO, US", you can expect to get 
    #   a response containing a single person object.
    # 
    # - A list of records (piplapis.data.containers.Record) that fully/partially 
    #   match the person from your query, if the query was for "Eric Cartman from 
    #   Colorado US" the response might also contain records of "Eric Cartman 
    #   from US" (without Colorado), if you need to differentiate between records 
    #   with full match to the query and partial match or if you want to get a
    #   score on how likely is that record to be related to the person you are
    #   searching please refer to the record's attributes 
    #   record.query_params_match and record.query_person_match.
    # 
    # The response also contains the query as it was interpreted by Pipl. This 
    # part is useful for verification and debugging, if some query parameters 
    # were invalid you can see in response.query that they were ignored, you can 
    # also see how the name/address from your query were parsed in case you 
    # passed raw_name/raw_address in the query.
    # 
    # In some cases when the query isn't focused enough and can't be matched to 
    # a specific person, such as "John Smith from US", the response also contains 
    # a list of suggested searches. This is a list of Record objects, each of 
    # these is an expansion of the original query, giving additional query 
    # parameters so the you can zoom in on the right person.
